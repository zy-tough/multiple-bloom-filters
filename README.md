# multiple-bloom-filters
[Python] A simple implementation of multiple bloom filters.

Please find hash functions on https://github.com/JamzyWang/HashCollector/blob/master/GeneralHashFunctions_Python/GeneralHashFunctions.py.

The bloom filter implementation is based on https://gist.github.com/josephkern/2897618. I just made small changes, such as the hash functions.
